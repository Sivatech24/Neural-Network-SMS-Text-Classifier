# Neural-Network-SMS-Text-Classifier
Neural Network SMS Text Classifier
Import Libraries: Ensure you have the necessary libraries imported. You'll likely need libraries such as pandas, numpy, tensorflow, and keras.

Load and Preprocess Data: Load the SMS Spam Collection dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps such as tokenization, padding, and encoding.

Build Neural Network Model: Define a neural network model for text classification. You can use techniques like embedding layers followed by LSTM or GRU layers for sequential data processing.

Compile Model: Compile the model with appropriate loss function and optimizer.

Train Model: Train the model using the training dataset.

Create predict_message Function: Define a function named predict_message that takes a message string as input, preprocesses it, predicts its class probability, and returns the likeliness of "ham" or "spam".

Test Model: Test your model and predict_message function using the test dataset and evaluate its performance.
